# Pepsi.Co-Data-Sicence-Shelf-Life-Study
Snack product shelf life is determined with a specific test protocol. As samples age, a sensory panel evaluates the aged sample versus a fresh sample. The dataset consists of 81 individual shelf life studies (Identified by the Study Number column) across a wide variety of snack products. Each of these studies has one or more samples. The column in the dataset named “Difference From Fresh” is the response from the sensory panel that were aged and evaluated by the sensory panel. Without going into the details of how this measure is generated, when this value is 20 or greater the aged sample at that time point is considered different enough from fresh that the product has reached its maximum shelf life.
